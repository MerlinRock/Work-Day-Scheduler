This app allows you to keep notes in each hour time slot. 

It is color formatted to remind you where you are at in the day.

Gray: in the past

Red: in the present

Green: in the future

After entering a note, click the save icon on the right and your note will remain in that time slot until deleted.
Make sure to save after you delete a note.

Stay organized!
